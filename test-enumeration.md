# OSW Data Service Unit Test Cases

THIS IS AUTOGENERATED DOCUMENT via  generate-test-enumeration.js script


## Purpose


This document details the unit test cases for the [OSW Data Service](https://github.com/TaskarCenterAtUW/TDEI-osw-datasvc-ts)

------------

## Test Framework

Unit test cases are to be written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/ "Jest")

------------

### Jest code pattern

```javascript
    describe("User Controller", () => {
        describe("Get List", () => {
            describe("Functional", () => {
                const getTestData => return {};
                it('{{Scenario}}, {{Expectation}}', () => {
                    //Arrange
                    let testData = getTestData();
                    let controller = new controller();
                    //Act
                    const result = controller.getVersions();
                    //Assert
                    expect(result.status).toBe(200);
                    expect(result.myAwesomeField).toBe('valid');
                });
            });
        });
    });
```
